 <p>
 如果要修改info.plist 和pch的路径
In the left side of the middle pane, select your app under "Targets"
Select the tab "Build Settings"
Search the following keywords: "info.plist" and "pch"
At this point it should be pretty clear which are the ones you need to modify.
Click on "Validate Settings" and you're done.
